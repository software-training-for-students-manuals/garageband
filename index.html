            <section class="topic"><h1>Creating a New Project</h1>
            <div class="side-image-medium">
                <img src="images/garageband-icon.png">
            </div>
            <p>To open GarageBand, go ahead to your launchpad or application folder and click on the brown guitar Garageband icon.</p>

            <p>A new window pops out with various options of project types. What project type you choose will start the project with the specific type of tracks. For example, if you choose <b>Songwriter</b>, the project start with some tracks that are helpful for songwriting, such as vocal, guitar and drum kit tracks; for <b>Voice</b>, the project starts with an audio track. It doesn't matter which project type you start with, you can create more tracks for other instruments and delete tracks within your project.</p>
            <div class="full-width-image">
                <img src="images/project-types.png">
            </div>
            <p><span class="highlight">Choose <b>Empty Project</b>.</span> On the left bottom corner, open the Details menu, and more options will collapse. You can change Tempo, Key Signature, Time Signature, Audio Input and Output under this menu.</p>
            <div class="full-width-image">
                <img src="images/creating-detailsmenu.png">
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Tempo:</b> the speed at which a piece of music is or should be played. The defualt is 120 bpm (tempo di marcia), which is a common tempo in music. It is often called march tempo.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Time Signature:</b> the signature defines how musical time is divided into measures and beats. The upper(left) number of the fraction controls the number of beats in each measure, and the lower(right) number controls the beat value(the length of the note that gets one beat). The default is 4/4, the most commonly used time signature.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Key Signature:</b> the key defines the central note to which the other notes relate. The key pop-up menu lists keys for the natural notes (such as C, D, and E) and for chromatic keys (such as F-sharp and E-flat). Users can choose the scale (major or minor) for the project.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Click <b>Choose</b>. The GarageBand will prompt you to create your first track. <span class="highlight">For now, just leave it as defualt (Record using a microphone or line input), and press <b>Create</b>.</span></p>
            <h2>Interface</h2>
            <p>Let's take a quick look at GarageBand's interface</p>

            <section class="topic"><h1>Working with Tracks</h1>
            <P>GarageBand has a few types of tracks that allows you to create music from Mac, record voice, and add a drummer that automatically play with your song. </P>

                    <h2>Keyboard Tips</h2>
                    <p>Users can change the octaves (key range), by dragging the blue bar left or right. Dragging to the left will give you a deeper octave and dragging to the right will gie you a higher octave.</p>

                <li>
                    <p><b>Click</b> the black and white keys to play the virtual Grand Piano. </p>
                </li>

                <p>Notice the rate at which you play the keys depends on how fast they are clicked. GarageBand's Musical Typing view turns the computer keyboard to a piano keyboard.</p>
                <li>
                    <p>To switch to <b>Musical Typing</b> mode, <b>Click</b> the icon with the letter 'A' located at the top-left of the keyboard window.</p>
                </li>
                <div class="centered-image-large">
                    <img src="images/track-keyboardcomputer.png">
                </div>
                <p>Each piano key is assigned to a key on your keyboard to make playing much easier. Settings for Octave, Velocity and Pitch Bend can also be adjusted in Musical Typing</p>
            </ol>
            <p>Not only the Steinway Grand Piano track has the keyboard feature, many other instruments in GarageBand also support this feature. <span class="highlight">Browse the Library to explore the variety of instruments in GarageBand.</span> </p>


            <h2>Working with Track Recording</h2>
            <p>Once you are comfortable using the keyboard, <span class="highlight">click the record button, the red circle located at the bottom of the window next to the playback buttons to start recording.</span></p>

                    <p>Press the play button to start or stop your cycle region playback.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Record Multiple Takes Using Cycle Region</h3>
            <p>You can record multiple takes over a cycled region, then decide which take is the best. This is useful if you want to pair a voice or an instrument to a specific area of your project. You are easily able to record as many takes as necessary, with each take appearing as its own track.</p>

            <section class="topic"><h1>Apple Loops</h1>
            <p>Apple Loops Utility is a companion audio utility to GarageBand. It contains pre-recorded music files, organized into categories, that can be used to easily add beats, rhythm parts, and other repeating patterns to a project. Loops contain musical patterns that can be repeated seamlessly. It is possible to extend a loop to fill any amount of time in a project, and they can be combined with other loops or recordings in your project.</p>
            <p>When you add an Apple Loop to a project, GarageBand creates a region for the loop in the timeline. <em>GarageBand automatically matched the temopo and key of the region to the project's tempo and key.</em> This lets users use several loops together, even if the loops were recorded at different keys and different speeds.</p>
